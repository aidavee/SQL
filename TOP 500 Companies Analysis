--Welcome to my analysis of the TOP 500 companies.  This will showcase my use of the following:
     --Grouping data using a CASE statement.
     --Use of HAVING clause to determine something interesting about the data per category.
     --Use  of logical operators like AND or OR to filter the data in an interesting way.
     --Use of aggregate function like AVG, SUM, COUNT, MAX, and/or MIN to return summary statistics about the data.



--1.  Categorize companies on whether or not they provide healthcare using a CASE statement.
--2.  Then Categorize companies based on the number of paid days off given.
